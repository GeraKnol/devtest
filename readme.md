# DevTest

## Introduction

We are interested to see your programming skills. We would like you
to take this simple PHP 5 test, so we can see how to solve problems.

## Guidelines

* Supply an object orientated solution
* Write your most beautiful code
* You are allowed to add files as you wish
* Since this is a backend test, you are allowed to use var_dump to output the response
* Don't forget to define docblock comments
* You are not allowed to use external libraries

## The challenge
You are going to filter an array of random data. If you look at `index.php` you will see the implementations we require from you.

For example:

~~~
/**
 * The following method will return all car models containing 3
 *
 * @todo implementation
 */
$app->myFunction();
~~~

We already have the Main class with the data pre-defined for you in `Application/Main.php`.

## Getting started
* Clone this repository
* Navigate to your localhost and check if everything is working (you should see "REYEZ! development test")

## When completed, please sent us:
* A zip archive containing the code or a fork to your git
* How long it took you to finish this test
* How difficult you thought it was (scale 1 to 10)
